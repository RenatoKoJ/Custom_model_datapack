# Custom_model_datapack
A datapack for minecraft, changing the model of specific items, like for example, changing only the selected the golden helmet for a crown. created using others datapacks as the base.


Custom Model made using files from: 
● CraisinLord
● Vanilla Tweaks
● MukiTanuki
● TheFinn
● Lona28
● ItsHydra

this custom model was created for particular use, in the streamer Vecet's server ( https://www.twitch.tv/vecettv )

While creating this pack I lost the file where I made note of the creators of most of the textures.
